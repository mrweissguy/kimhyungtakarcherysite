I developed Korean archery skill about 50 years ago.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.380 align:middle line:84%
I also created the Korean archery federation's teaching manual.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.600 align:middle line:84%
I published my archery book "Kim, Hyung-Tak Archery".

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Many archers learned how to shoot while reading my book,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.380 align:middle line:84%
but many archers want to learn skills by watching videos.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.740 align:middle line:84%
This time I made an application for archery.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.680 align:middle line:84%
This application has many videos and photographs

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:84%
and detailed explanations to make archery easy to learn.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.160 align:middle line:84%
I believe this application will help many archers learn archery well.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for your interest in this application.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.480 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much.
