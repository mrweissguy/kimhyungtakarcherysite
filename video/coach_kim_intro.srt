00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:11,220
I developed Korean archery skill about 50 years ago.

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,960
I also created the Korean archery federation's teaching manual.

3
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,980
I published my archery book "Kim, Hyung-Tak Archery".

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,020
Many archers learned how to shoot while reading my book,

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,120
but many archers want to learn skills by watching videos.

6
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,220
This time I made an application for archery.

7
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,240
This application has many videos and photographs

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:49,420
and detailed explanations to make archery easy to learn.

9
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,620
I believe this application will help many archers learn archery well.

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,480
Thanks for your interest in this application.

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,500
Thank you very much.
